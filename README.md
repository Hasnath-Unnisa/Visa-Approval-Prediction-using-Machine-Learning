**# Visa Approval Prediction using Machine Learning**



**## Abstract**



This project builds multiple machine learning classification models to predict visa approval outcomes using the EasyVisa dataset. The analysis covers data preprocessing, feature engineering, model training, and evaluation. Models such as Decision Tree, Random Forest, Gradient Boosting, AdaBoost, and Bagging are compared to identify the best-performing classifier for predicting visa approvals.



**## Objectives**



\- Understand and explore the EasyVisa dataset.

\- Perform data cleaning, encoding, and feature selection.

\- Apply multiple ML algorithms for classification.

\- Evaluate performance using metrics like Accuracy, Precision, Recall, and F1-score.

\- Identify the most accurate and reliable model.

\- Present a well-structured and reproducible ML project.

**## Setup Instructions**



1\. Create and activate a Python virtual environment:

&nbsp;  

&nbsp;  python -m venv venv

&nbsp;  venv\\Scripts\\activate



2\. Install dependencies:



pip install -r requirements.txt



3\. Launch Jupyter Lab or Notebook:



jupyter lab



4\. Open and run all cells in:



source\_code/Visa\_approval.ipynb



**Data**



The project uses the EasyVisa dataset for classification tasks.

If the dataset contains personal or confidential information, do not upload the full file.

Instead:



Add a small anonymized sample named sample\_easyvisa.csv inside the data/ folder, or



Add a README.md inside data/ explaining how to access the dataset.



**Results**



The notebook includes:



* Model performance comparisons (Decision Tree, Random Forest, Gradient Boosting, AdaBoost, Bagging)
* Confusion matrix and classification report
* Selection of the best model based on evaluation metrics



**How to Reproduce**



All code, data references, and dependencies are provided.

Follow the setup steps, then execute the notebook in order to reproduce the results.
